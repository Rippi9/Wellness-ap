# WELLNESS APP


# User Story    
As someone who is thinking about going to the gym I would like to keep track of my activities on a weekly basis, and I want to enter a list of my cooking ingredients at home and receive a list of meals I can cook.

# Description
The Wellness App is designed for people who want to keep track of their fitness and food consumption.
The Wellness App allows users to keep track of exercise activities on a weekly basis. This is achieved by allowing a user to select the day of the week, along with a muscle group and difficulty selector. The user selections are combined to generate a list of possible exercise for the specified muscle group. The user can save multiple numbers of exercises to each day of the weekly calendar. The exercise calendar can be cleared apon user input to clean out the calendar for a new week - alternatively, a user may want to complete the same routine of exercise week on week, which is also made possible.

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
